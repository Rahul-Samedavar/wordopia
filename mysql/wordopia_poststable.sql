Let\'s embark on a cosmic journey to explore the mysterious realms of black holes, where gravity reaches its extreme, and the fabric of spacetime twists into a gravitational abyss.\r\n\r\nFormation: The Cosmic Ballet of Stellar Collapse\r\n\r\nBlack holes are born through the cosmic ballet of stellar collapse. When massive stars exhaust their nuclear fuel, gravitational forces take center stage, causing the star to implode under its immense weight. This collapse results in the formation of a singularity, a point in space where gravity becomes infinitely strong, surrounded by the boundary known as the event horizon.\r\n\r\nEvent Horizon: The Point of No Return\r\n\r\nThe event horizon marks the boundary beyond which escape becomes impossible, even for light itself. Once an object crosses this point of no return, it is inexorably drawn toward the singularity at the heart of the black hole. The event horizon acts as an invisible cloak, concealing the mysteries that unfold within the gravitational clutches of the black hole.\r\n\r\nSingularities: The Cosmic Infinites\r\n\r\nAt the heart of a black hole lies the singularity, a point of infinite density and gravity. Classical physics breaks down in the presence of such extremes, and our current understanding fails to describe the nature of the singularity. It becomes a cosmic enigma, a point where the laws of the universe as we know them cease to exist.\r\n\r\nTypes of Black Holes: Stellar, Intermediate, and Supermassive\r\n\r\nBlack holes come in various sizes, each with its distinct characteristics. Stellar black holes, born from collapsing massive stars, have a mass several times that of our sun. Intermediate black holes bridge the gap between stellar and supermassive black holes, while the latter, residing at the centers of galaxies, can have masses millions or even billions of times that of our sun.\r\n\r\nHawking Radiation: The Quantum Whispers of Black Holes\r\n\r\nDespite their dark reputation, black holes are not entirely silent. According to physicist Stephen Hawking, black holes can emit a faint radiation known as Hawking radiation. This quantum phenomenon suggests that, over immense periods, black holes can slowly lose mass and eventually evaporate, leaving behind a trail of subatomic whispers in the cosmic void.\r\n\r\nInterstellar Portals or Cosmic Graveyards?\r\n\r\nBlack holes have stirred both scientific curiosity and popular imagination, giving rise to debates about their nature. Some theorists propose the idea of black holes as interstellar portals, while others see them as cosmic graveyards where matter and information vanish from our observable universe. The ongoing quest to reconcile quantum mechanics and general relativity fuels our exploration of these cosmic mysteries.\r\n\r\nBeyond the Event Horizon: The Information Paradox\r\n\r\nOne of the profound puzzles surrounding black holes is the information paradox. As matter enters a black hole, it seemingly disappears from our universe, challenging the principle of information conservation. The resolution of this paradox holds the key to a deeper understanding of the fundamental nature of space, time, and the fabric of reality.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, black holes, with their gravitational prowess and cosmic riddles, continue to beckon astronomers and physicists into uncharted territories. As we delve deeper into the heart of these celestial enigmas, the mysteries they conceal may not only reshape our understanding of the cosmos but also unveil the secrets of the very fabric of spacetime itself. The journey into the darkness of black holes is an odyssey that sparks scientific wonder and fuels the human quest for cosmic understanding.',3,'[\"piii\", \"rahul_di\", \"longlostAuthor\"]','2024-01-14 08:57:17'),('puneet~Biosynthesis: Unraveling Natures Molecular Symphony','Biosynthesis: Unraveling Natures Molecular Symphony','puneet','Biosynthesis is a captivating process that unfolds within the intricate machinery of living organisms, orchestrating the creation of an astounding array of molecular compounds essential for life.

I’m sweating bullets at this point but she’s having none of it.\r\n\r\n“Can’t you just do it, Mam?”\r\n\r\nI’m absolutely knackered. I’ve been stabbing at this thing for (no joke) fifteen minutes but she just will not take it off me.\r\n\r\nI’m not sure why this isn’t working ‘cos usually when I’m doing stuff wrong, she’ll tell me she’ll just do it herself in that mardy voice she puts on when she thinks I’m being daft.\r\n\r\nRight now, though she’s getting on like she’s had a complete personality transplant, the way she’s talking to me. ‘Petal,’ for a start. She’s not called me that since primary school.\r\n\r\n“Well done, doll!” She laughs and beams at me so wide that I can see the two gold fillings on her back teeth.\r\n\r\nFreaky.\r\n\r\nThank God I’ve managed to get to the other side of the mega potato though.\r\n\r\n“Right. Next step,” she says, “What does it say on the paper?”\r\n\r\nChrist. Looks like I’m not getting out of helping with the whole meal then. I never even said I wanted to learn to cook so I’ve no idea where she’s pulled this from.\r\n\r\nI reach over the bowl of limp potatoes and slide the recipe over to our end of the dining table.\r\n\r\n“Erm.

He’s usually such a freak about his stuff being in the right place.\r\n\r\n“Sophie!” Mam shouts from the kitchen. “You don’t need to go all the way up the stairs to get a lighter that’s in the hallway, do you? Hurry up!”\r\n\r\nDon’t have time to solve this mystery right now. I don’t want a hiding from Mam.\r\n\r\nI fish the lighter out Big Daz’s scruffy pocket and run back to the kitchen. Mam’s clattering pans about and shoving drawers in and out like she’s getting paid for it.\r\n\r\n“Soph?” She puts all her pans down and turns round to face me. “Do you know how to light the hob, petal?”\r\n\r\nShe’s still got her stretchy smile on. Only now there’s sad in her eyes, not frustration. Christ. I really hope Our Elaine gets back soon. She’s better at talking than me when Mam gets like this.\r\n\r\nI’m also crossing my fingers that Big Daz doesn’t get back from work before Elaine comes home ‘cos Mam’s been mega fumin’ at him recently. Elaine says she knows why but she gets on like I’m too young to understand when I ask her what’s been goin’ on. I reckon’ that means she doesn’t actually know though.\r\n\r\n“I think so, Mam.” I flick the lighter up and down four times before it finally sets the hob going.\r\n\r\nThank God.\r\n\r\n“Right. Olive oil.” Mam’s voice is shaking now. I think she might be crying? “Chop chop Soph, you’ve got to learn to stand on your own two feet ‘cos I won’t be around forever you know.”\r\n\r\nWhat’s she talking about? I’m properly scared now. She never normally gets like this in the day.\r\n\r\nI grab the olive oil and start pouring. “Mam? Are you okay?”\r\n\r\n“I’m fine Soph! Why wouldn’t I be fine?” she snaps. She holds her fingers up like I did before. I think she’s trying to make me laugh so I force out an anxious giggle.\r\n\r\n“Onions.” She points towards the pan and then turns her back to me. I shove them into the pan and the oil spits in my face so much that I almost go flying off my step stool.\r\n\r\nI get down and wipe my face on a tea-towel whilst Mam isn’t looking still. I don’t want her to think I’ve done it wrong ‘cos that’ll make her angry mental instead of sad mental.\r\n\r\nShe’s holding onto the counter so hard her fingertips are turning white, and her shoulders are shaking up and down like she’s shrugging a coat off.\r\n\r\n“Mam?”\r\n\r\nThe way she whips her head round it’s like she’s forgot I was there.\r\n\r\nThe stretchy smile is gone now, and her eyes are massive and red.\r\n\r\nNormally, when Elaine or Big Daz are in, they send me upstairs at this point ‘cos they don’t want me to see Mam going soft.\r\n\r\nIt’s probably fine. It’s not like she’s gonna hurt me. It’s just Mam but soft.\r\n\r\n“Let’s eat what we’ve got, eh! I’m ravenous!” she says.\r\n\r\nWhat we’ve got is four dry potatoes and some hard onions. But I don’t want her to get even more soft so I’m just gonna get on like I agree with her.\r\n\r\n“Okay.”\r\n\r\nShe grabs the hot pan off the hob and neatly pours the oily onions into four little piles on the dining room table.\r\n\r\nRight. Guess we’re not doing plates then.\r\n\r\nShe’s pointing at me to put the potatoes with the onions but when I go to do it, she slaps my hand away.\r\n\r\n“Sophie! For Christ’s sake!” she snaps. “Put them at the side, not on top. We’re not heathens.”\r\n\r\nI really hope Our Elaine gets home soon. I’d even take Big Daz at this point. I just don’t want to be alone with her anymore.\r\n\r\nShe sits down in front of one of the mush piles and pats the seat next to her.\r\n\r\nOh God.\r\n\r\nI’m really scared now. I’ve never seen her this bad.\r\n\r\n“Now you can cook! You’ll be right as rain on your own. I mean, it really would have been better to teach Our Elaine but she’s God knows where…”\r\n\r\nI’m not even sure she’s talking to me at this point. She’s not looking at me. She’s getting on like she’s telling the chopping board all about our cooking lesson.\r\n\r\n“Mam?”\r\n\r\nHer head snaps up.\r\n\r\n“Sophie!” There’s tears in her eyes again now. “I don’t want you to think less of me.”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean, Mam?” My eyes are watering, and the back of my throat is stinging like it does when I eat a Toxic Waste.\r\n\r\nI go and sit next to her.\r\n\r\nI can hear my heart beating in my ears. “It’s all fine. Let’s just eat our tea, yeah?” I tell her.\r\n\r\nShe can’t say daft things if her mouth’s full.\r\n\r\nShe grabs my face and stares at me with the red eyes. “Fine.” She sighs. I don’t know how she’s doing it but she’s crying without moving her face.\r\n\r\nI’m so scared.\r\n\r\nMam’s pushing the mush around in different directions with her pinkie fingers now, making different shapes on the dining table.\r\n\r\nI can hear someone unlocking the door.\r\n\r\nThank God.\r\n\r\n“Sorry I’m late back, Miss James didn’t let us out ‘till quarter past!” Elaine is shouting from the porch. “I’m just gonna have a quick shower, I’m sweating bollocks!”\r\n\r\nAs soon as she starts up the stairs Mam stops pushing her potato pile around and slams her hands down on the table.\r\n\r\n“Elaine! Come down, Mam needs you for something!” I shout. The way we’re sat means I’m in the corner next to the lamp so I can’t get past Mam to get to the stairs. I really hope Our Elaine can hear me. I can’t stand this much longer.\r\n\r\nSomething’s really up with Mam’s eyes. She looks exactly like Liam Miller’s dog did before it tore up that rabbit.\r\n\r\nShe stands up so fast she sends her chair flying into the lamp.\r\n\r\nOh God. There’s glass bits all over the floor now but she doesn’t seem to care ‘cos she’s just run straight through them all to get to the stairs.\r\n\r\n“Elaine!” she’s screaming now. I don’t think I’ve ever heard anyone sound like this.\r\n\r\n“What?” Elaine’s shouting back down to her now, she sounds like she’s panicking a bit.\r\n\r\nThen she screams. Elaine this time, not Mam. I can tell it’s Elaine ‘cos she used to scream right loud like that whenever Georgie from next door would bring his pet snake out its cage.\r\n\r\nThis scream is different though. She sounds as if a hundred pet snakes have just crawled out from out the bathroom walls and bit her right in the face.\r\n\r\nI can hear Mam running up the stairs to Elaine, but I can’t go anywhere ‘cos there’s a million shards of glass in the way.\r\n\r\nChrist.\r\n\r\nI reckon I can reach the tea-towel drawer from here. I think if I put them all out on top of each other like a red carpet it won’t wreck my feet.\r\n\r\nI wonder how fuming Big Daz would be if I called him at work.\r\n\r\nI hop onto my tea towel carpet and jump straight back off into the hallway.\r\n\r\nGot away with that, I think.\r\n\r\nOh God. What the hell is going on?\r\n\r\nElaine is in absolute hysterics, but I can’t hear a thing she’s saying ‘cos she’s crying too much.\r\n\r\nI’m in the hall now. In my head I’m running but whenever I take a step it feels like I’ve got super glue on the bottom of my socks.\r\n\r\nNow I’ve finally made it to the bottom of the stairs I can hear Mam talking. She’s stopped screaming now and she’s pleading with Elaine about something in this really creepy sounding crackly whisper.\r\n\r\n“Elaine. I love you, petal! I love you all. Please!” she says.\r\n\r\n The super glue sticks me down to the bottom of the stairs. Whatever’s in the bathroom is the reason I wasn’t allowed to get changed out my uniform when I got home from school.\r\n\r\nI’ve never ever heard Elaine like this. She’s usually so grown up about everything but right now she sounds about five years old. You can’t sound like that if you’re just being daft. Something’s really wrong.\r\n\r\nI don’t know what to do. I can’t tell if calling Big Daz will make it worse or not. I also can’t remember if they reconnected the house phone after Mam wouldn’t pay that man who came round from BT who she thought was a scammer.\r\n\r\nRight.\r\n\r\nI need to know what’s happening before I even think about trying to call anyone.\r\n\r\nI’m just gonna do it in bursts. I think that’ll make it easier.\r\n\r\nOk.\r\n\r\nRight. That’s ten steps done.\r\n\r\nFive.\r\n\r\nThen the last three.\r\n\r\nI shove Big Daz’s jeans out the way and stand at the top of the landing. Mam and Elaine are all the way at the other end of the hallway next to the bathroom.\r\n\r\nElaine’s sitting rocking herself back and forwards outside the bathroom door and Mam’s stood over her just staring at her. She’s doing that mental silent cry that you only normally see in films.\r\n\r\nOh God.\r\n\r\nI can see it now.\r\n\r\nI’m right close to the bathroom an’ I can see it now.\r\n\r\nIt’s Big Daz.\r\n\r\nHe’s sat up but he looks kind of floppy. One of his arms is hanging over the bath and the other one is behind his back. He doesn’t have any jeans on, and the Big Knife is sat on the floor next to him. There’s blood on everything.\r\n\r\nOh God.\r\n\r\nI look at Mam and then back at Daz and then back at Mam again.\r\n\r\nI think I’m gonna be sick.\r\n\r\n“Sophie!” Elaine jumps up and wraps her arms around my head.\r\n\r\n“Don’t look Soph. Don’t look. Don’t look.” She says into my hair.\r\n\r\nOh God. I can hear myself screaming but it doesn’t feel like it’s me doing it. I feel like I’m watching myself from out of my body. I watch as I vomit all over Elaine’s shoulder and down her back.\r\n\r\nShe’s shaking me now, saying we have to leave. That we’re not safe here and we have to get out the house. Mam’s just been staring at us, crying motionlessly.\r\n\r\nShe can’t have done this. Does she not feel anything? Why isn’t her face moving? How has she just watched me chop up that potato knowing Big Daz was up here dead this whole time? When did she kill him? Was he already dead when I got home?\r\n\r\nI want to ask her, but I can’t move my mouth. I can’t seem to move anything.\r\n\r\nElaine stops shaking me now and throws me over her shoulder. She walks us both as fast as she can to the end of the landing but before she reaches the top of the stairs Mam’s sprints to block the top of the stairs.\r\n\r\nShe’s holding the Big Knife.\r\n\r\nElaine screams again and throws me down on the landing behind her.\r\n\r\n“Mam! Look at me, please! You’re not well! We don’t blame you, Mam! We all saw how he treated you!” Elaine’s practically screaming this in her face, but Mam just walks straight past her and stands at the very top of the stairs.\r\n\r\nWhen she finally speaks, she doesn’t turn to face us.\r\n\r\n“At least you won’t go hungry” she says.\r\n\r\nShe holds the knife pointy side up and lets her knees go floppy all the way down to the bottom of the stairs. \r\n',1,'[\"test1\"]','2024-01-14 07:22:58'),('test1~Embracing Tomorrow: The Unstoppable Rise of Automation','Embracing Tomorrow: The Unstoppable Rise of Automation','test1','Introduction:\r\n\r\nIn the rapidly evolving landscape of technology, automation stands out as a transformative force reshaping industries, economies, and the way we live and work.

This mysterious dance of interconnected particles has captured the imagination of physicists for nearly a century, providing a glimpse into the intricate and often perplexing nature of the quantum realm.\r\n\r\nThe Origin of Quantum Entanglement:\r\n\r\nQuantum entanglement was first introduced by Albert Einstein, Boris Podolsky, and Nathan Rosen in their groundbreaking 1935 paper, famously known as the EPR paradox. The concept emerged as a consequence of the fundamental principles governing quantum systems, particularly superposition and the nature of quantum states.\r\n\r\nIn a state of superposition, particles can exist in multiple states simultaneously until a measurement is made, at which point they \'collapse\' into one of the possible states. Quantum entanglement takes this concept further by linking the states of two or more particles, even if they are separated by vast distances.\r\n\r\nThe Enigma of Spooky Action at a Distance:\r\n\r\nEinstein, in his critique of quantum entanglement, referred to it as \"spooky action at a distance\" — a term that reflects the apparent instantaneous connection between entangled particles, irrespective of the physical separation. This phenomenon puzzled physicists and led to intense debates about the completeness of quantum theory.\r\n\r\nEntangled particles exhibit correlations that cannot be explained by classical physics. When the state of one particle is measured, the state of the other particle, no matter the distance between them, is instantaneously determined. This instantaneous connection challenges our intuitive understanding of cause and effect, pushing the boundaries of our classical notions of space and time.\r\n\r\nEntanglement in Practice:\r\n\r\nEntanglement has been experimentally observed and confirmed through various ingenious experiments. One such experiment involves entangled particles known as quantum pairs, often photons. These particles, once entangled, share correlated properties — if the state of one particle is measured, the state of the other particle is simultaneously determined.\r\n\r\nResearchers have demonstrated the entanglement of particles across considerable distances, suggesting the existence of a mysterious, faster-than-light communication that defies the limitations imposed by the speed of light in classical physics.\r\n\r\nApplications in Quantum Computing and Communication:\r\n\r\nBeyond its enigmatic nature, quantum entanglement holds great promise for technological advancements. In the realm of quantum computing, entangled particles can be harnessed to create qubits, the building blocks of quantum information processing. The inherent correlations in entangled states enable quantum computers to perform certain computations exponentially faster than classical computers.\r\n\r\nMoreover, entanglement plays a crucial role in quantum communication, specifically in the development of quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols. QKD leverages the principles of quantum entanglement to secure communication channels, providing an unbreakable form of encryption based on the principles of quantum mechanics.\r\n\r\nThe Quest for a Deeper Understanding:\r\n\r\nWhile quantum entanglement has been experimentally verified and harnessed for practical applications, its underlying mechanisms remain shrouded in mystery. The nature of the entanglement process, the role of hidden variables, and the implications for our understanding of reality continue to be subjects of ongoing research and philosophical contemplation.\r\n\r\nAs physicists delve deeper into the quantum realm, the enigma of entanglement stands as a testament to the profound and counterintuitive nature of the subatomic world. It challenges our classical intuitions, pushing the boundaries of what we thought possible and inviting us to explore the mysteries that lie at the heart of quantum mechanics. In the dance of entangled particles, the quest for understanding persists, propelling us into the fascinating and intricate landscape of quantum reality.',2,'[\"test1\", \"piii\"]','2024-01-24 15:17:19'),('test1~The Enchanted Lighthouse','The Enchanted Lighthouse','test1','Once upon a time, in a quaint coastal village named Serenity Bay, there stood a mysterious lighthouse that captured the hearts and imaginations of the villagers. The lighthouse, known as the \"Whispering Beacon,\" was said to possess magical powers that only revealed themselves to those with pure intentions.\r\n\r\nThe protagonist of our story, a young fisherman named Elias, lived on the outskirts of Serenity Bay. Elias had always been fascinated by the tales surrounding the Whispering Beacon, passed down through generations. One stormy night, as the rain lashed against the village and the waves roared with fury, Elias found himself drawn to the flickering light of the magical lighthouse.\r\n\r\nDriven by curiosity and a sense of adventure, Elias braved the tempest and reached the base of the Whispering Beacon. To his amazement, the lighthouse\'s glow intensified as if recognizing the purity within him. A soft, melodic hum filled the air, and Elias felt an invisible force guiding him to a hidden door at the lighthouse\'s base.\r\n\r\nWith a hesitant touch, Elias pushed open the door and entered a mystical chamber bathed in an ethereal glow. The room was adorned with ancient symbols and shelves filled with enchanted objects. At the center stood an ancient sea nymph, guardian of the Whispering Beacon, named Celestia.\r\n\r\nCelestia revealed the lighthouse\'s purpose—to protect the village from sea monsters and guide lost ships to safety. However, the magic that powered the lighthouse was fading, and it needed a pure-hearted soul to rekindle its strength. Elias, chosen by the Whispering Beacon itself, accepted the responsibility.\r\n\r\nGuided by Celestia, Elias embarked on a quest to collect rare ingredients required to renew the lighthouse\'s magic. Along the way, he encountered mythical creatures, solved riddles, and formed unlikely alliances. Each challenge brought him closer to his goal, and Elias discovered the true power of kindness and courage.\r\n\r\nAs the last ingredient was placed within the Whispering Beacon, a radiant light enveloped Serenity Bay. The storm ceased, and the sea monsters retreated into the depths. The villagers, once fearful, now looked upon Elias with gratitude.\r\n\r\nIn recognition of his bravery, Elias was appointed the keeper of the Whispering Beacon. From that day forward, the lighthouse stood as a symbol of hope and protection for Serenity Bay. Elias continued his life as a fisherman, but his heart forever carried the magic of the enchanted lighthouse.\r\n\r\nAnd so, the tale of Elias and the Whispering Beacon became a cherished legend, shared by generations, reminding the villagers that even in the darkest storms, a single act of kindness could illuminate the path to a brighter tomorrow.',2,'[\"piii\", \"test1\"]','2024-01-14 07:22:58'),('test1~The Enduring Legacy of Spider-Man: Weaving a Cinematic Web','The Enduring Legacy of Spider-Man: Weaving a Cinematic Web','test1','Since his first appearance in \"Amazing Fantasy\" #15 in 1962, Spider-Man has swung into the hearts of comic book enthusiasts and moviegoers alike.
